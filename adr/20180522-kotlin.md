# Kotlin as a project language 

## Status

Accepted

## Context 

We are free to pick any JVM language with static typing.

Developers are not expected to have any background with jvm languages except java.

Kotlin looks like a "better Java" option with painless on-boarding. 

Scala is a radical move towards functional paradigm.   

## Decision 

We will adopt Kotlin as a project language.

## Consequences  

Project will be migrated to Kotlin
